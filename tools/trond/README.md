# trond

`trond` is a command-line tool written in Golang using the [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) framework, which is used for creating powerful modern CLI applications.
`trond` simplifies the configuration and operation of various `docker-tron` features, allowing you to start various features with a single command.

## Prerequisites
- Shell Environment: Required for running shell scripts.
- Golang Build Environment: The [build_trond.sh](../../build_trond.sh) script will attempt to install the necessary Golang environment.

## Installation

1. Clone the `tron-docker` repository from GitHub and navigate to the repository directory:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-docker.git
    cd tron-docker/
    ```

2. Build the `trond` binary. Run the following command to generate the trond executable:

    ```sh
    # this will generate trond in current directory
    ./build_trond.sh
    ```

## Usage
You can explore all the commands supported by trond using the following command:
```
./trond -h
```

### Available Commands
Now it supports the following commands:
- `./trond snapshot`
  - These commands are used to manage and download database snapshots, allowing you to start a node without syncing from the genesis block
- `/trond docker`
  - Build and test the java-tron Docker image locally. Note that this is optional for deploying a node, as you can use the official Docker image from Docker Hub.
- `./trond node`
  - Deploy java-tron node for various networks.

### Examples

Here we show examples of downloading the mainnet database snapshot, then deploy a java-tron node based on it.
It is recommended to run these commands in `tron-docker` root directory.

#### 1. Download the Mainnet database snapshot

First, download the latest mainnet lite fullnode snapshot from the default source (`34.143.247.77`) to the current directory:

```
./trond snapshot download default-main
```

After the download completes, the database will be extracted to `./output-directory/mainnet/database` of current directory.

Notice: The snapshot is large(46G on 24-Jan-2025). It may take above 1 hour to finish. You could add `nohup` to make it continue running even after you log out of your terminal session.
The full command will be `nohup ./trond snapshot download default-main &`

#### 2. Deploy a java-tron node on Mainnet

Next, start a node connecting to the Mainnet:

```
./trond node run-single -t full-main
```

This command will trigger execution of the [docker-compose](../../single_node/docker-compose.fullnode.main.yml). It will use the database at `./output-directory/mainnet/database`.
If the directory is empty, the node will sync transaction data from the genesis block. If you donâ€™t need the snapshot, you can skip the download step.

To view the node logs, you can access them at `./logs/mainnet`, or you can use the command `docker exec tron-node tail -f ./logs/tron.log`.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the help command or the [command documentation](./docs/trond.md).
