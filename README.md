# TRON Docker

This repository provides tools and guidance to help the community quickly get started with the TRON network and development.

## Features

### üöÄ Quick start for single FullNode
Easily deploy a single TRON FullNode connected to **Mainnet** or **Nile testnet** using Docker. Follow the instructions to get your node up and running in minutes.

### üîó Private chain setup
Set up your own private TRON blockchain network for development and testing. The provided configurations simplify deployment and management, making it ideal for custom use cases.

### üìä Node monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
Monitor the health and performance of your TRON nodes with integrated **Prometheus** and **Grafana** services. Real-time metrics and visualizations are just a few steps away.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools
We also provide tools to facilitate the CI and testing process:
- **Gradle Docker**: Automate the build and testing of the `java-tron` Docker image using Gradle.
- **DBFork**: Launch a private java-tron network based on the Mainnet database state, enabling shadow fork testing.
- **Stress Test**: Execute the stress test and evaluate the performance of the java-tron fullnode.
